      <h1>Grad School at Arizona?</h1>

      <p>Perhaps you’re thinking about applying to study philosophy at the University of Arizona. Perhaps you are a prospective student, with offer in hand, trying to decide whether to accept Arizona’s offer. Or perhaps you just accidentally clicked the link to this page. Whatever the case, the questions and answers below outline some features of graduate student life here at Arizona from the perspective of one current student. It’s geared to the reader who’s curious about the program and student life at Arizona.</p>

      <p>Read on if that interests you. And if you have questions that aren’t answered here, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:nballantyne@fordham.edu">nballantyne@fordham.edu</a>.</p>

      <h2>Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A.?</h2>

      <p>Yes, the University of Arizona is located in Tucson. Check a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=tucson+map&hl=en&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&ll=44.21371,-92.724609&spn=30.456697,82.265625&z=4&om=1">map</a>. It’s probably far from your home.  It sure is far from mine in Ontario, Canada.  Tucson, originally &ldquo;Chuk Shon&rdquo;, is south of Phoenix and north of Mexico.  It used to be part of Mexico, actually, and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/">Augustine of Hippo</a>,  a philosopher of no small stature, is the <a href="http://www.diocesetucson.org/staug.html">patron saint</a> of the city. Tucson is located in a desert, so it’s hot. But as the locals say, &ldquo;It’s a dry heat&rdquo;.  Although Tucson is warm for most of the year, the cooler months, November to February,  are the reward for those (like me) who dread +32C/+90F temperatures.  Sometimes, it even snows in the city, and often there’s snow on the overlooking mountains. What is there to do in Tucson? See below for an answer.</p>

      <h2>How is the program structured? And how about funding? And what will I spend my time doing?</h2>

      <p>The program is five years in length, though the average time to completion is longer. Full funding is guaranteed for five years and is usually available beyond that.  You’ll have to earn your keep, of course. Some fellowships and research assistantships are available,  and these free you from teaching or TA duties, but usually you’ll have teaching or TA work. Professors often need help -- grading for a class, proofreading manuscripts, or organizing conferences -- so that’s one way to  get to know faculty and pick up extra income.</p>

      <p>When all is said and done, you will be a newly minted PhD and hopefully the better for it. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. First, there are requirements to complete: course work, area exams, ‘starred’ paper, prospectus, and dissertation. The details on program requirements are available in full on the <a href="http://philosophy.arizona.edu/">philosophy department’s website</a>. Here, I’ll offer a brief outline of the program’s timeline along with commentary. Again, nothing here is official; go <a href="http://philosophy.arizona.edu/">here</a> for the details.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Year one</dt>
        <dd>

          <p><em>Course work</em> dominates this year’s landscape. You’ll take three or four seminars and/or co-convening classes each term. <em>Seminars</em> meet once each week for three hours and are open only to grad students. A seminar session typically involves discussion of the week’s readings and/or short papers (&ldquo;shorties&rdquo;) prepared by students, read in advance by seminar members. At term’s end, you’ll present a paper &#224; la ‘APA format’: a short talk followed by a commentary, plus questions from the audience. <em>Co-convening classes</em> meet at least twice weekly and are open to both grads and senior undergrads. A co-convening class meeting is much like the classes you took during undergrad: you’ll get a lecture and some student discussion. The grad students and the professor may meet once weekly for more in-depth discussion of the readings. Typically, you will submit a term paper and/or write an exam at term’s end. All first year students take the Proseminar in the fall, which is open only to incoming students.  That’s the only mandatory seminar offering, however, so there’s some flexibility.  If you want to get to know Professor, enroll in Professor’s seminar.  If you want to learn more about this or that, take a course on this or that. It’s your chance to learn about stuff that you won’t touch in your dissertation, so don’t be afraid to take something new. Since there are breadth requirements, be sure to consult with the graduate coordinator about course selection.</p>

          <p>This year, you will begin to get to know students and faculty. And perhaps you’ll get a better sense for what you might work on. Join a reading group or start one yourself. A group might meet regularly to discuss a new monograph or items from an area exam list. If you enter grad school planning to work on x but switch to y (and then again to z), that’s fine.  Your application’s Personal Statement wasn’t written in stone, and no one holds you to it. Work on what interests you.  The school year is busy, so keep a notebook of ideas and a ‘To Read’ list for your breaks. A reasonable goal is to write a term paper or two that can be submitted to conferences or salvaged for another project. Try to get feedback on your work.  Ask your professors and fellow students for comments on drafts. Be willing to offer feedback, too.  Exchanging work with others initiates worthwhile conversation and hones your skills.</p>

        </dd>

        <dt>Year two</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>More course work lies in wait (three or four courses each term). You’ll begin to prepare for <i>area exams</i> toward the middle or end of year two, aiming to complete these toward the beginning of year three. It’s easy for some (like me!) to get stressed about these exams, but don’t you do that. You will read a bunch of articles and books, and then write and talk about some of it. The exams are for <em>you</em>. Pick two areas, a major and a minor, and then ask four faculty members to sit on your committee, two on the major side, two on the minor. It’s useful to think of the major and/or minor areas as preparation for dissertation research. Your exam committee members will help you draw up a reading list and must approve of your plan. Then you’ll read, take notes, talk about the material with classmates and faculty -- and then read some more. Do whatever it takes to position yourself to write two exams and talk through an oral exam (read: a conversation with your committee) on the material from your list.</p>

          <p>During year two, you’ll think about possible dissertation topics. See if there’s a dissertation topic that naturally falls out of what you’re thinking about. I know one student who wrote a series of papers in years one and two that might have been initial drafts of a couple dissertation chapters.  But then that student decided to work on something else. Remember that you’re picking a topic that’s going to stick around with you for a few years. You’ll probably talk to a couple hundred people about x, in formal and informal settings. Do you care enough about x to do that and enjoy it? Will x get you out of bed each morning? Try to select a topic that matters to you. Talk to more senior students about their experiences as ‘dissertators’.  Sit in on a dissertation group to see what projects others are developing.  Aim to attend some conferences.</p>

        </dd>

        <dt>Year three</dt>
        <dd>

          <p>Around now, you’ll complete your area exams. (Update: in 2007, the program was modified so that incoming students must aim to complete area exams in August-September of third year.) There will be bit more course work (two to four courses) to mop up, and you'll also begin the <em>‘starred’ paper</em>. The purpose of the ‘starred’ paper requirement is to help you develop the chops to produce high-quality philosophical writing. Like the area exams, this requirement is for you. Two faculty members will guide you in the revision of the paper.  You’ll receive plenty of feedback before the paper is judged. A reasonable goal is to submit this paper to conferences or a journal. (Is it a reasonable expectation that this paper be <i>accepted</i> at a conference or journal? Depends on the venue, I guess.)</p>

          <p>Once you’re through with area exams and course work, only the <em>prospectus</em> stands between you and the dissertation. The prospectus is one chapter of the dissertation plus an outline of projected chapters. You’ll present the prospectus to three faculty members, likely those who will compose your dissertation committee. The committee will provide feedback on how best to tackle the dissertation. </p>

      </dd>

      <dt>Year four and beyond</dt>
      <dd>

        <p>This is where the dissertation begins to take shape. Wisdom, I’m told, says that &ldquo;a good dissertation is a done dissertation&rdquo;. There are in-house venues to test out your dissertation material: dissertation reading groups and a fall dissertation seminar led by two faculty members. It’s a good idea to take the show on the road, too, and conferences offer a trial run for your material. Suppose you’re writing a dissertation on topic x. It’s one thing to get people who know you -- and who think x is a neat topic, because they taught or took a seminar on x -- to care about x for a few minutes; it’s another to get strangers to care. Getting strangers to care is important.</p>

        <p>Eventually, you’ll have an oral defence and if you pass, a copy of your dissertation will appear on a shelf in the Arizona philosophy department library. That’s your initial contribution to the Academy and Our Wealth of Knowledge. Future grad students may even pick through the footnotes, laughing at your well played jokes; but probably not. But, by then, who cares?  You’ll already have a job and grad school will be but a dream. So, you ask, how does the department prepare students for the job market? See below for an answer.</p>

        <p>Some Arizona students visit other departments after course work and exams, spending a semester or two in another academic environment. It’s probably wise to learn a little about your new-found biases by discovering the biases of philosophers and students elsewhere -- and perhaps learn what biases you would have acquired had you studied elsewhere. Maybe you’ll be defending non-cognitivism in metaethics, or whatever. So go and hang-out with cognitivists and find out what sort of philosophy student you would have become if history had been otherwise.</p>

        <p>Make time to write. Ensure that time is yours and can’t get gobbled up by anyone or anything but your writing. Read some books on writing and try out the tips and tricks. I like <a href="http://books.apa.org/books.cfm?id=4441010"><em>How To Write A Lot</em></a> by Paul Silvia and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Your-Dissertation-Fifteen-Minutes/dp/080504891X"><em>Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day</em></a> by Joan Bolker.</p>

    <h2>How does the department prepare students for the profession and job market?</h2>

    <p>It prepares students in various ways. There’s a writing sample workshop in the spring before you hit the job market. The goal is to get the sample into shape and prepare for job interview discussions. So far as I can tell, professors are on the whole good at vetting applicants’ dossiers. Perhaps more importantly, the placement director ensures that applicants are ready in the lead-up to sending off applications. Each fall, Dave Schmidtz gives a helpful talk on how to prepare for the job market and answers questions. Faculty are available to discuss different aspects of professional life, and do what they can to advise. Seminars include ‘APA format’ student presentations, so everyone practices giving a talk before a job talk. Word on the street is that a paper publishing seminar is in the offing.</p>

    <p>Then there’s a general atmosphere of diligence and friendliness: professors here <em>demonstrate</em> how to work hard and how to be a good colleague. That said, I suspect that some of your fellow students will do more to get you prepared than the faculty.  Students are the ones who will quibble for hours over whether this distinction holds up or whether that premise is true; they’ll tell you that your prose here or there is a dark saying, and that you should find a better title for that paper. You’ll learn a lot from them.</p>

    <h2>Where do students live?</h2>

    <p>Most live off campus, in houses or apartments. Monthly rent typically runs from $400 to $550, though I know of some who pay less than $400. Apparently, that’s inexpensive, given rental costs in other U.S. cities. Some students choose to buy rather than rent and (hope to) turn a profit upon leaving Tucson.</p>

    <p>There are a number of neighbourhoods around campus within easy walking or biking distance of the philosophy department. One of the nicer ones is the Sam Hughes neighbourhood, named after an early settler to Tucson, who diverted water from the <a href="santacruz.html">Santa Cruz River</a> for agricultural purposes. The Santa Cruz River is now dry for most of the year. (There’s more on the decline of the Santa Cruz <a href="santacruz.html">here</a>.) Even if you don’t live in Sam Hughes, it’s nice to walk through. For my first two years in Tucson, I lived in the so-called &ldquo;Philosophers’ Ghetto&rdquo;, located in the Pie Allen neighbourhood. The Ghetto is home to some eight or ten philosophy grad students in a typical year. Rumor has it that in the 1990s some students lived in the &ldquo;House of Phil&rdquo;, next to a Baptist church and a brothel. House of Phil was demolished a few years back. Perhaps, somehow, that’s a metaphor for something or other.

    <h2>Are most students at Arizona satisfied?</h2>

    <p>I’d say so. Speaking only about myself, my supervisors and the students I interact with make Arizona an excellent place for me to study. Others seem to have similar experiences.  If you’re interested in (now out-of-date) survey data, you’ll see <a href="http://philosophy.arizona.edu/peo-students">here</a> that the program fared well with respect to &ldquo;overall satisfaction&rdquo;. Not satisfied?  Well, since I can’t rightly speak for anyone but myself, why not ask some <a href="http://philosophy.arizona.edu/peo-students">others</a>?</p>

    <h2>Aside from grad school, what’s there to do in Tucson?</h2>

    <p>Outdoor activities are here in abundance for those so inclined. Tucson is situated near five mountain ranges, so hiking and mountain biking are natural bets. Road biking is also popular. Some members of the department are into these activities so it isn’t difficult to join in. I got into hiking during my first year, and added mountain biking in second year. Wandering southern Arizona’s back roads, where ghost towns and empty spaces abound, is also worth a try. Mountains, deserts, and wildlife make photography a predictable hobby here.</p>

    <p>Speaking of photography, there’s an impressive <a href="http://creativephotography.org/">photography centre</a> on campus -- which, according to its website, &ldquo;holds more archives and individual works by 20th-century North American photographers than any other museum in the nation&rdquo;. There are also galleries, museums, and music venues in Tucson. Visit the javelinas and raptors at the <a href="http://www.desertmuseum.org/">Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum</a>. Or why not check out the latest exhibition at the <a href="http://www.tucsonmuseumofart.org/">Tucson Museum of Art</a>? Or just ask around the department for things to do: the graduate students are never short of ideas.</p>
